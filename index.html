        <p id="introductionary-paragraph">Hello there. I'm that bearded young man in the picture above. I currently live in <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/0k2OY">Frankfurt am Main, Germany</a> and am currently employed as a software developer at <a href="http://cosee.biz">CoSee GmbH</a>. My work there is mainly focused on writing JEE applications, though Python has been a steady companion.</p>

        <h2>Mindset</h2>
        <p>I reckon my greatest skill is my love for clean, good code. Whatever languages and frameworks I might encounter in my personal and professional future, this skill will always accompany me. Readability induces maintainability induces good code induces less headache. Simple as that.</p>

        <p>To give you an idea of how I operate, I'll provide you with a set of things I find worth mentioning about me</p>

        <h4>Meta</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><abbr title="Behavioural driven development">BDD</abbr></li>
          <li>I love git</li> <!-- I would hire myself right away if I read that. ;) -->
          <li>I can do nice things with the shell!</li>
          <li>I'd rather use a good library than write but one unnecessary line of code</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Java</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>I have worked with the whole stack, from Java ME over Android to Java SE and JEE 6</li>

          <li>I don't overengineer. You won't see an <code>AbstractListItemViewHolderListenerFactory</code> from me. Promise.</li>
          <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Effective-Java-2nd-Joshua-Bloch/dp/0321356683">Effective Java</a> is my bible, and Joshua Bloch a personal inspiration when it comes to Java</li>

        <p>I am aware of the fact that I have yet seen only so little of my profession. And there a few things I want to do, but haven't got around to due to temporal or personal constraints, and I would list them here &dash; They are as important to my professional identity as the things I <em>CAN</em> do.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>I've never tried Rails and I always look in envy over to their developers. They seem to be very productive.</li>
          <li>I have yet to contribute to the open-source community</li>
          <li>Even though I love Python dearly, I don't feel my code still isn't as good as it could be.</li>
          <li>My project managing skills have not yet been tested outside university</li>

        <h2>Projects</h2>

        <p>As mentioned earlier, I haven't yet got around to really participate in open-source development due to my investment in my current employment. I do have a few coding projects I'm working on, whenever I have the spare time <span class="ironic-remark">(there's more to life than code, after all)</span>.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/wonderb0lt/raxacoricofallapatorius-bot">The raxacoricofallapatorius Bot</a> was a little test project to get my coding on with node.js. It retweets stuff that I say under <a href="https://twitter.com/Wunderbolzen">@Wunderbolzen</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/wonderb0lt/liquid-tally">Liquid-Tally</a> - a simple REST web service, with HTML frontend for managing who drinks what at CoSee GmbH</li>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/wonderb0lt/personal-hp">This very homepage</a>, completely handcrafted. Hey, at least I tried HTML5!</li>
          <li>...and that's it. More to come whenever I have a stroke of genius. <span class="ironic-remark">Also, I'm not good with project names.</span></li>
