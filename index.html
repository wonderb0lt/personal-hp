        <p id="introductionary-paragraph">Hello there. I'm that bearded young man in the picture above. I currently live in <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/0k2OY">Frankfurt am Main, Germany</a> and am currently employed as a software developer at <a href="http://cosee.biz">CoSee GmbH</a>. My work there is mainly focused on writing JEE applications, though Python has been a steady companion.</p>

        <h2>Mindset</h2>
        <p>I reckon my greatest skill is my love for clean, good code. Whatever languages and frameworks I might encounter in my personal and professional future, this skill will always accompany me. Readability induces maintainability induces good code induces less headache. Simple as that.</p>

        <p>To give you an idea of how I operate, I'll provide you with a set of things I find worth mentioning about me</p>

        <h4>Meta</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><abbr title="Behavioural driven development">BDD</abbr></li>
            <li>I love git</li> <!-- I would hire myself right away if I read that. ;) -->
            <li>I can do nice things with the shell!</li>
            <li>I'd rather use a good library than write but one unnecessary line of code</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Java</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>I have worked with the whole stack, from Java ME over Android to Java SE and JEE 6</li>

            <li>I don't overengineer. You won't see an <code>AbstractListItemViewHolderListenerFactory</code> from me. Promise.</li>
            <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Effective-Java-2nd-Joshua-Bloch/dp/0321356683">Effective Java</a> is my bible, and Joshua Bloch a personal inspiration when it comes to Java</li>

        <h4>Python</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://blog.startifact.com/posts/older/what-is-pythonic.html">Pythonicity</a> is not just a funny word to me</li>

            <li>I'll write <a href="http://pythonhosted.org/behave/">features</a> instead of unit tests.</li>
            <li>Python is a multi-purpose language, not just "something to write little scripts with"</li>

        <p>I am aware of the fact that I have yet seen only so little of my profession. And there a few things I want to do, but haven't got around to due to temporal or personal constraints, and I would list them here &dash; They are as important to my professional identity as the things I <em>CAN</em> do.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>I've never tried Rails and I always look in envy over to their developers. They seem to be very productive.</li>
            <li>I have yet to contribute to the open-source community</li>
            <li>Even though I love Python dearly, I don't feel my code still isn't as good as it could be.</li>
            <li>My project managing skills have not yet been tested outside university</li>

        <h2>Projects</h2>

        <p>I don't do private and/or open-source projects as much as I would like to,. I do have a few coding projects though on which I work whenever I have the spare time to <span class="ironic-remark">(there's more to life than code, after all)</span>.</p>

            <li>...and some minor projects that pop up on <a href="wonderb0lt">my account</a> and fizzle out of existence when I don't feel like it anymore.</li>
